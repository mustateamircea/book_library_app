Hello World!

This here is my first ever slightly complex (for me, at this point) project in C++!
It is part of my Introduction to Programming course I have followed during my post-graduate IT studies ("Informatica Aplicata si Programare") at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca.

The program holds a user sheet/file that contains the books the users have borrowed (initialized by the user with the book's title, author, ID, and days borrowed), implemented using a C-style array of structs (as these were the requirements provided by the course professor). When launched, it opens a console menu where the users have a number of options.
They can calculate their penalty (5 Euros / Day) for failure to return the book (applicable only if the user failed to return the book after the 14th day), they can return books by ID and see their
sheet/file after the operation is done, and finally can exit the program.

As I learn more, I plan to add new functionalities and also add a Graphical Interface for this program.
